 *    
 * Computes the magnitude of the elements of a complex data vector.    
 *   
 * The <code>pSrc</code> points to the source data and    
 * <code>pDst</code> points to the where the result should be written.    
 * <code>numSamples</code> specifies the number of complex samples    
 * in the input array and the data is stored in an interleaved fashion    
 * (real, imag, real, imag, ...).    
 * The input array has a total of <code>2*numSamples</code> values;    
 * the output array has a total of <code>numSamples</code> values.    
 * The underlying algorithm is used:    
 *    
 * <pre>    
 * for(n=0; n<numSamples; n++) {    
 *     pDst[n] = sqrt(pSrc[(2*n)+0]^2 + pSrc[(2*n)+1]^2);    
 * }    
 * </pre>    
 *    
 * There are separate functions for floating-point, Q15, and Q31 data types.
