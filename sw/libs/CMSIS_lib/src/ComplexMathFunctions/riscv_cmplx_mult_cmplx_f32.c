 *        
 * Multiplies a complex vector by another complex vector and generates a complex result.        
 * The data in the complex arrays is stored in an interleaved fashion        
 * (real, imag, real, imag, ...).        
 * The parameter <code>numSamples</code> represents the number of complex        
 * samples processed.  The complex arrays have a total of <code>2*numSamples</code>        
 * real values.        
 *        
 * The underlying algorithm is used:        
 *        
 * <pre>        
 * for(n=0; n<numSamples; n++) {        
 *     pDst[(2*n)+0] = pSrcA[(2*n)+0] * pSrcB[(2*n)+0] - pSrcA[(2*n)+1] * pSrcB[(2*n)+1];        
 *     pDst[(2*n)+1] = pSrcA[(2*n)+0] * pSrcB[(2*n)+1] + pSrcA[(2*n)+1] * pSrcB[(2*n)+0];        
 * }        
 * </pre>        
 *        
 * There are separate functions for floating-point, Q15, and Q31 data types.
