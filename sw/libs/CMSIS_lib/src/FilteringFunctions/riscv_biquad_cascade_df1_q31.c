/**    
 * @brief Processing function for the Q31 Biquad cascade filter.    
 * @param[in]  *S         points to an instance of the Q31 Biquad cascade structure.    
 * @param[in]  *pSrc      points to the block of input data.    
 * @param[out] *pDst      points to the block of output data.    
 * @param[in]  blockSize  number of samples to process per call.    
 * @return none.    
 *    
 * <b>Scaling and Overflow Behavior:</b>    
 * \par    
 * The function is implemented using an internal 64-bit accumulator.    
 * The accumulator has a 2.62 format and maintains full precision of the intermediate multiplication results but provides only a single guard bit.    
 * Thus, if the accumulator result overflows it wraps around rather than clip.    
 * In order to avoid overflows completely the input signal must be scaled down by 2 bits and lie in the range [-0.25 +0.25).    
 * After all 5 multiply-accumulates are performed, the 2.62 accumulator is shifted by <code>postShift</code> bits and the result truncated to    
 * 1.31 format by discarding the low 32 bits.    
 *    
 * \par    
 * Refer to the function <code>riscv_biquad_cascade_df1_fast_q31()</code> for a faster but less precise implementation of this filter for Cortex-M3 and Cortex-M4.
