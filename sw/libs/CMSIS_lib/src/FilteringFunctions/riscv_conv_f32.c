 * @defgroup Conv Convolution    
 *    
 * Convolution is a mathematical operation that operates on two finite length vectors to generate a finite length output vector.    
 * Convolution is similar to correlation and is frequently used in filtering and data analysis.    
 * The CMSIS DSP library contains functions for convolving Q7, Q15, Q31, and floating-point data types.    
 * The library also provides fast versions of the Q15 and Q31 functions on Cortex-M4 and Cortex-M3.    
 *    
 * \par Algorithm    
 * Let <code>a[n]</code> and <code>b[n]</code> be sequences of length <code>srcALen</code> and <code>srcBLen</code> samples respectively.    
 * Then the convolution    
 *    
 * <pre>    
 *                   c[n] = a[n] * b[n]    
 * </pre>    
 *    
 * \par    
 * is defined as    
 * \image html ConvolutionEquation.gif    
 * \par    
 * Note that <code>c[n]</code> is of length <code>srcALen + srcBLen - 1</code> and is defined over the interval <code>n=0, 1, 2, ..., srcALen + srcBLen - 2</code>.    
 * <code>pSrcA</code> points to the first input vector of length <code>srcALen</code> and    
 * <code>pSrcB</code> points to the second input vector of length <code>srcBLen</code>.    
 * The output result is written to <code>pDst</code> and the calling function must allocate <code>srcALen+srcBLen-1</code> words for the result.    
 *    
 * \par    
 * Conceptually, when two signals <code>a[n]</code> and <code>b[n]</code> are convolved,    
 * the signal <code>b[n]</code> slides over <code>a[n]</code>.    
 * For each offset \c n, the overlapping portions of a[n] and b[n] are multiplied and summed together.    
 *    
 * \par    
 * Note that convolution is a commutative operation:    
 *    
 * <pre>    
 *                   a[n] * b[n] = b[n] * a[n].    
 * </pre>    
 *    
 * \par    
 * This means that switching the A and B arguments to the convolution functions has no effect.    
 *    
 * <b>Fixed-Point Behavior</b>    
 *    
 * \par    
 * Convolution requires summing up a large number of intermediate products.    
 * As such, the Q7, Q15, and Q31 functions run a risk of overflow and saturation.    
 * Refer to the function specific documentation below for further details of the particular algorithm used.    
 *
 *
 * <b>Fast Versions</b>
 *
 * \par 
 * Fast versions are supported for Q31 and Q15.  Cycles for Fast versions are less compared to Q31 and Q15 of conv and the design requires
 * the input signals should be scaled down to avoid intermediate overflows.   
 *
 *
 * <b>Opt Versions</b>
 *
 * \par 
 * Opt versions are supported for Q15 and Q7.  Design uses internal scratch buffer for getting good optimisation.
 * These versions are optimised in cycles and consumes more memory(Scratch memory) compared to Q15 and Q7 versions
