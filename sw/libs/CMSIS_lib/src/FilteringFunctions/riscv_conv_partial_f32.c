 * @defgroup PartialConv Partial Convolution    
 *    
 * Partial Convolution is equivalent to Convolution except that a subset of the output samples is generated.    
 * Each function has two additional arguments.    
 * <code>firstIndex</code> specifies the starting index of the subset of output samples.    
 * <code>numPoints</code> is the number of output samples to compute.    
 * The function computes the output in the range    
 * <code>[firstIndex, ..., firstIndex+numPoints-1]</code>.    
 * The output array <code>pDst</code> contains <code>numPoints</code> values.    
 *    
 * The allowable range of output indices is [0 srcALen+srcBLen-2].    
 * If the requested subset does not fall in this range then the functions return RISCV_MATH_ARGUMENT_ERROR.    
 * Otherwise the functions return RISCV_MATH_SUCCESS.    
 * \note Refer riscv_conv_f32() for details on fixed point behavior.   
 *
 * 
 * <b>Fast Versions</b>
 *
 * \par 
 * Fast versions are supported for Q31 and Q15 of partial convolution.  Cycles for Fast versions are less compared to Q31 and Q15 of partial conv and the design requires
 * the input signals should be scaled down to avoid intermediate overflows.   
 *
 *
 * <b>Opt Versions</b>
 *
 * \par 
 * Opt versions are supported for Q15 and Q7.  Design uses internal scratch buffer for getting good optimisation.
 * These versions are optimised in cycles and consumes more memory(Scratch memory) compared to Q15 and Q7 versions of partial convolution
