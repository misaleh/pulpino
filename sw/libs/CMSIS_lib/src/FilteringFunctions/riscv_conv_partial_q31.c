 * @brief Partial convolution of Q31 sequences.    
 * @param[in]       *pSrcA points to the first input sequence.    
 * @param[in]       srcALen length of the first input sequence.    
 * @param[in]       *pSrcB points to the second input sequence.    
 * @param[in]       srcBLen length of the second input sequence.    
 * @param[out]      *pDst points to the location where the output result is written.    
 * @param[in]       firstIndex is the first output sample to start with.    
 * @param[in]       numPoints is the number of output points to be computed.    
 * @return Returns either RISCV_MATH_SUCCESS if the function completed correctly or RISCV_MATH_ARGUMENT_ERROR if the requested subset is not in the range [0 srcALen+srcBLen-2].    
 *    
 * See <code>riscv_conv_partial_fast_q31()</code> for a faster but less precise implementation of this function for Cortex-M3 and Cortex-M4.
