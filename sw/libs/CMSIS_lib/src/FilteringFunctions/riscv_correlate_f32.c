/**    
 * @defgroup Corr Correlation    
 *    
 * Correlation is a mathematical operation that is similar to convolution.    
 * As with convolution, correlation uses two signals to produce a third signal.    
 * The underlying algorithms in correlation and convolution are identical except that one of the inputs is flipped in convolution.    
 * Correlation is commonly used to measure the similarity between two signals.    
 * It has applications in pattern recognition, cryptanalysis, and searching.    
 * The CMSIS library provides correlation functions for Q7, Q15, Q31 and floating-point data types.    
 * Fast versions of the Q15 and Q31 functions are also provided.    
 *    
 * \par Algorithm    
 * Let <code>a[n]</code> and <code>b[n]</code> be sequences of length <code>srcALen</code> and <code>srcBLen</code> samples respectively.    
 * The convolution of the two signals is denoted by    
 * <pre>    
 *                   c[n] = a[n] * b[n]    
 * </pre>    
 * In correlation, one of the signals is flipped in time    
 * <pre>    
 *                   c[n] = a[n] * b[-n]    
 * </pre>    
 *    
 * \par    
 * and this is mathematically defined as    
 * \image html CorrelateEquation.gif    
 * \par    
 * The <code>pSrcA</code> points to the first input vector of length <code>srcALen</code> and <code>pSrcB</code> points to the second input vector of length <code>srcBLen</code>.    
 * The result <code>c[n]</code> is of length <code>2 * max(srcALen, srcBLen) - 1</code> and is defined over the interval <code>n=0, 1, 2, ..., (2 * max(srcALen, srcBLen) - 2)</code>.    
 * The output result is written to <code>pDst</code> and the calling function must allocate <code>2 * max(srcALen, srcBLen) - 1</code> words for the result.    
 *    
 * <b>Note</b>   
 * \par  
 * The <code>pDst</code> should be initialized to all zeros before being used.  
 *  
 * <b>Fixed-Point Behavior</b>    
 * \par    
 * Correlation requires summing up a large number of intermediate products.    
 * As such, the Q7, Q15, and Q31 functions run a risk of overflow and saturation.    
 * Refer to the function specific documentation below for further details of the particular algorithm used.    
 *
 *
 * <b>Fast Versions</b>
 *
 * \par 
 * Fast versions are supported for Q31 and Q15.  Cycles for Fast versions are less compared to Q31 and Q15 of correlate and the design requires
 * the input signals should be scaled down to avoid intermediate overflows.   
 *
 *
 * <b>Opt Versions</b>
 *
 * \par 
 * Opt versions are supported for Q15 and Q7.  Design uses internal scratch buffer for getting good optimisation.
 * These versions are optimised in cycles and consumes more memory(Scratch memory) compared to Q15 and Q7 versions of correlate
