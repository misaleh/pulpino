 * @brief Processing function for the Q15 FIR interpolator.    
 * @param[in] *S        points to an instance of the Q15 FIR interpolator structure.    
 * @param[in] *pSrc     points to the block of input data.    
 * @param[out] *pDst    points to the block of output data.    
 * @param[in] blockSize number of input samples to process per call.    
 * @return none.    
 *    
 * <b>Scaling and Overflow Behavior:</b>    
 * \par    
 * The function is implemented using a 64-bit internal accumulator.    
 * Both coefficients and state variables are represented in 1.15 format and multiplications yield a 2.30 result.    
 * The 2.30 intermediate results are accumulated in a 64-bit accumulator in 34.30 format.    
 * There is no risk of internal overflow with this approach and the full precision of intermediate multiplications is preserved.    
 * After all additions have been performed, the accumulator is truncated to 34.15 format by discarding low 15 bits.    
 * Lastly, the accumulator is saturated to yield a result in 1.15 format.
