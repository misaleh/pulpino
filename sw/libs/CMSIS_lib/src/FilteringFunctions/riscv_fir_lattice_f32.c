 * @defgroup FIR_Lattice Finite Impulse Response (FIR) Lattice Filters    
 *    
 * This set of functions implements Finite Impulse Response (FIR) lattice filters    
 * for Q15, Q31 and floating-point data types.  Lattice filters are used in a     
 * variety of adaptive filter applications.  The filter structure is feedforward and    
 * the net impulse response is finite length.    
 * The functions operate on blocks    
 * of input and output data and each call to the function processes    
 * <code>blockSize</code> samples through the filter.  <code>pSrc</code> and    
 * <code>pDst</code> point to input and output arrays containing <code>blockSize</code> values.    
 *    
 * \par Algorithm:    
 * \image html FIRLattice.gif "Finite Impulse Response Lattice filter"    
 * The following difference equation is implemented:    
 * <pre>    
 *    f0[n] = g0[n] = x[n]    
 *    fm[n] = fm-1[n] + km * gm-1[n-1] for m = 1, 2, ...M    
 *    gm[n] = km * fm-1[n] + gm-1[n-1] for m = 1, 2, ...M    
 *    y[n] = fM[n]    
 * </pre>    
 * \par    
 * <code>pCoeffs</code> points to tha array of reflection coefficients of size <code>numStages</code>.    
 * Reflection Coefficients are stored in the following order.    
 * \par    
 * <pre>    
 *    {k1, k2, ..., kM}    
 * </pre>    
 * where M is number of stages    
 * \par    
 * <code>pState</code> points to a state array of size <code>numStages</code>.    
 * The state variables (g values) hold previous inputs and are stored in the following order.    
 * <pre>    
 *    {g0[n], g1[n], g2[n] ...gM-1[n]}    
 * </pre>    
 * The state variables are updated after each block of data is processed; the coefficients are untouched.    
 * \par Instance Structure    
 * The coefficients and state variables for a filter are stored together in an instance data structure.    
 * A separate instance structure must be defined for each filter.    
 * Coefficient arrays may be shared among several instances while state variable arrays cannot be shared.    
 * There are separate instance structure declarations for each of the 3 supported data types.    
 *    
 * \par Initialization Functions    
 * There is also an associated initialization function for each data type.    
 * The initialization function performs the following operations:    
 * - Sets the values of the internal structure fields.    
 * - Zeros out the values in the state buffer.    
 * To do this manually without calling the init function, assign the follow subfields of the instance structure:
 * numStages, pCoeffs, pState. Also set all of the values in pState to zero. 
 *    
 * \par    
 * Use of the initialization function is optional.    
 * However, if the initialization function is used, then the instance structure cannot be placed into a const data section.    
 * To place an instance structure into a const data section, the instance structure must be manually initialized.    
 * Set the values in the state buffer to zeros and then manually initialize the instance structure as follows:    
 * <pre>    
 *riscv_fir_lattice_instance_f32 S = {numStages, pState, pCoeffs};    
 *riscv_fir_lattice_instance_q31 S = {numStages, pState, pCoeffs};    
 *riscv_fir_lattice_instance_q15 S = {numStages, pState, pCoeffs};    
 * </pre>    
 * \par    
 * where <code>numStages</code> is the number of stages in the filter; <code>pState</code> is the address of the state buffer;    
 * <code>pCoeffs</code> is the address of the coefficient buffer.    
 * \par Fixed-Point Behavior    
 * Care must be taken when using the fixed-point versions of the FIR Lattice filter functions.    
 * In particular, the overflow and saturation behavior of the accumulator used in each function must be considered.    
 * Refer to the function specific documentation below for usage guidelines.
