 * <b>Scaling and Overflow Behavior:</b>    
 * \par    
 * The function is implemented using an internal 64-bit accumulator.    
 * The accumulator has a 2.62 format and maintains full precision of the intermediate multiplication results but provides only a single guard bit.    
 * Thus, if the accumulator result overflows it wraps around rather than clip.    
 * In order to avoid overflows completely the input signal must be scaled down by log2(numTaps) bits.    
 * After all multiply-accumulates are performed, the 2.62 accumulator is right shifted by 31 bits and saturated to 1.31 format to yield the final result.  
 *    
 * \par    
 * Refer to the function <code>riscv_fir_fast_q31()</code> for a faster but less precise implementation of this filter for Cortex-M3 and Cortex-M4.
