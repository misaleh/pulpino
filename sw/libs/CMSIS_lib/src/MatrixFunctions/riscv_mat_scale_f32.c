 * Multiplies a matrix by a scalar.  This is accomplished by multiplying each element in the        
 * matrix by the scalar.  For example:        
 * \image html MatrixScale.gif "Matrix Scaling of a 3 x 3 matrix"        
 *        
 * The function checks to make sure that the input and output matrices are of the same size.        
 *        
 * In the fixed-point Q15 and Q31 functions, <code>scale</code> is represented by        
 * a fractional multiplication <code>scaleFract</code> and an arithmetic shift <code>shift</code>.        
 * The shift allows the gain of the scaling operation to exceed 1.0.        
 * The overall scale factor applied to the fixed-point data is        
 * <pre>        
 *     scale = scaleFract * 2^shift.        
 * </pre>
